### The Philosophy

The code gym is like a real life gym. But its code.

Duh right? Well the metaphor is that maybe in training you aren't doing the things you would do on the field but you are training your body to be able to do them at a high level when you get ready.

The code gym is a gym for your mind.

Maybe you don't write code that requires understanding data structures and algorithms or puzzle solving every day... but you do want your code to run efficiently every day. 

Here in the code gym we work on things that make us better at what we do.

Working with these kinds of problems and subjects improves our thinking.


### How its structured

Just like there are different racks and weights in a gym there are different ways to train in the code gym.

The gym is organized by language and subject.

For instance `javascript/data_structures`

Is data structures in js and 

`ruby/toj`

is timus online judge solutions (http://acm.timus.ru/?locale=en) in ruby.
